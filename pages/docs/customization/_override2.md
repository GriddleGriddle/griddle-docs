While this example only interacted with one component, many custom components can be passed in to the `components` prop on Griddle.
While this is a great way to handle customization, [Plugins](../plugins/) can often be a cleaner solution for handling multiple overrides -- especially
if these same set of custom components may be reused on other Griddle components.
