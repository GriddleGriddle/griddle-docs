As noted in other sections, Griddle is written to be customized. In earlier versions
of Griddle, it became apparent that the architectural choices that we made were
limiting how people could use the grid. While having a starting point is nice,
constantly adding new features at the cost of code clarity / filesize is not ideal.

Griddle 1.0 is based on plugins -- so much so that things that used to be
core Griddle features are now plugins.
