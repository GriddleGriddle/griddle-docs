The remote plugin provides a configurable way to load data that might not be available locally.

Install with `npm install griddle-remote-plugin` and import or require the
plugin. The remote plugin allows you to specify the request / response format,
as well as specify the provider used for loading data (such as `superagent` or 
your own).
