The selection plugin inserts a checkbox on each grid row and provides state management
for selecting rows of data within the grid.

Install the selection plugin with `npm install griddle-selection-plugin` and
import or require it into the component where Griddle is defined. Add the
imported plugin to the `plugins` prop on Griddle.
