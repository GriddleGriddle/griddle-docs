Provides subgrid functionality in Griddle. When a data row has a `children`
property, an icon will be added to the left-most column with expand/collapse state.
Clicking on the icon will either expand or collapse the row.

Install with `npm install griddle-subgrid-plugin` and import or require the
plugin. The imported plugin can be added to the Griddle plugins array prop.
