This example is providing very similar functionality to the shorthand version above, however, there are additional properties we can give to the columns as well such as "order" among
other things. You may notice state is showing up before name now (matching the order) -- even if you check and uncheck the column's visibility. <a href="#">For more on these properties, check out the "Customization" section</a> (TODO: put in the actual link).
